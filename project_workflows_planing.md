# **Planning The `Workflow`and `Structure` Of This Project.**

## **WorkFlows:**

1. **User Authentication (Basic Web Dev)**:
    - Users will log in with email and password.
    - Technologies:
        - `Django` (Python based) - Backend
        - `Firebase` - Authentication

2. **Platform & Job Role Selection (UI/UX & Backend)**:
    - Users select platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.), job roles, and job post dates.
    - Create a `UI`.

3. **Resume Upload & Storage (Backend + File Management)**:
    - Users upload their resumes.
    - Securely store user `resumes` using `Google Cloud Storage`.

4. **Automatic Resume Enhancement (NLP + AI)**:
    - Automatically enhance resumes based on the job role and posting.
    - `NLP-based Parsing:` Utilize models like `SpaCy` or `BERT` to analyze job requirements and user experience.
    - `Automated Resume Enhancer:` Build a model to restructure resumes according to job descriptions while ensuring ATS compliance.
    - `Cover Letter Generation:` Fine-tune GPT-like models for personalized cover letter creation.

5. **Application Automation (Web Scraping + Automation)**:
    - Automatically apply for jobs, including visiting external websites.
    - Utilize `Selenium` for browser automation.
    - Address challenges posed by varying application flows across platforms.

6. **Cold Email Outreach (NLP + Automation)**:
    - Fetch company HR emails and send personalized outreach emails.
    - Implement `Web Scraping:` with tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for email extraction.
    - `Cold Email Generation:` Use GPT models for tailored messaging.

7. **ATS Compliance (NLP)**:
    - Optimize resumes for ATS requirements.
    - Build a model to check for keyword matching and formatting compliance.

8. **Data Export (CSV)**:
    - Allow users to export CSV files for project analysis.
    - Use `Pandas` in Python for CSV handling.

9. **Dashboard (Data Visualization)**:
    - Visualize job applications (applied, accepted, rejected) with filtering options.
    - Utilize libraries like D3.js or Plotly for frontend data visualization.
    - Store job data in databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

10. **Personalization via AI**:
    - Tailor not just resumes but also email outreach based on company culture and job specifics.

11. **Real-Time Job Alerts**:
    - Send notifications for relevant job openings using APIs or web scraping.

12. **User Feedback Loop**:
    - Allow users to rate enhanced resumes and improve the model over time.
